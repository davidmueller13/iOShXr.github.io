Hi, This is the official github for Aaron @iOShXr!

[NOTE PLAYING AROUND WITH SYSTEM FILES CAN LEAVE YOUR DEVICE DAMAGED OR BRICKED]

For the two tweaks i host here "BetterWatchNotifications" and "BetterAppleMusicMod"
download the folder and extract the .dylib and .plist files 
and put them in this directory on your iOS device...

/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/

RESPRING AFTER!!!

Please note the other package i host here "AFC2-84" (Apple File Conduit 2) for iOS 8.4
is intended for developer use only as it requires being added to the filesystem 
so install at your own risk.
